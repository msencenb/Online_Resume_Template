Here are the most common ways to modify this theme:

1) Add a section
2) Add a subsection
3) Change the color of the banner and text titles


1) Adding a section

Looking in index.html look for lines that begin like this:

<div class="partialspacer">

If you want to make a brand new section simply copy everything between the opening <div class="partialspacer"> and closing </div>.
Afer that... just fill in your info!

2) Add a subsection

Let's say you want to add a section to the "Technical Skills section".
Copy and paste this after subsection (after the closing </div> of a <div class="content"> tag) and fill in your info:

<div class="clearboth"></div>
<div class="halfdivider"></div>
<div class="clearboth"></div>
<div class="sectiontitle">
	Insert your title
</div>
<div class="clearboth"></div>
<div class="time">
	2 Years Experience
</div>
<div class="clearboth"></div>
<div class="content">
	Nunc mollis egestas tortor, non bibendum urna volutpat ut. Duis a metus diam. Praesent placerat, erat id molestie facilisis, odio tortor suscipit augue, non lacinia ipsum arcu id ipsum.
</div>			

You can copy and paste any subsection.. copying and pasting a section from the work experiences section will give you bullets.


3) Changing the color of the banner and text
Since this theme is almost all pure HTML/CSS you can customize it a lot!
This means changing the color throughout the theme is very simple.

First open the file "resume.css". Starting at line 14 of the file you will see the following lines:
".bannerhead" ".sectiontitle" ".triangle"

All you have to do is change the "background" property of the .bannerhead,
the "color" of the .sectiontitle, and the border-color of the .triangle. Listed below are some
popular color schemes. If you want to make up your own color scheme you might check out
